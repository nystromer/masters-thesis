# Musical Instrument Activity Detection using Self-Supervised Learning and Domain Adaptation

This is an old repostiory where I automatically backed up my notebooks when working on [my thesis](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-310&pid=diva2%3A1466885&c=2&searchType=SIMPLE&language=en&query=carl+nystr%C3%B6mer&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all). 

Making the repo public for anyone interested or looking to reproduce the results.

To produce the final results I used [beautify_preprocessing.ipynb](/beautify_preprocessing.ipynb) in conjunction with [cleaner_crnn_mix.ipynb](/cleaner_crnn_mix.ipynb).

The notebooks will unfortunately not work OOTB since I never created a Requirements.txt/makefile for the dependencies/file downloads, but it should be possible to get them running with some work.
